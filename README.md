Parallelizing Strassen’s Matrix-Multiplication Matrix
Developed a parallel implementation of Strassen’s recursive algorithm using C++ for computing matrix-multiplications utilizing the concept of shared-memory on OpenMP. Computed the product of two matrices of size n x n, where n=2k, and k is an input to your program.
